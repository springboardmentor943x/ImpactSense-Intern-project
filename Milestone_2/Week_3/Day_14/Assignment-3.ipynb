This is a relatively low R-squared value, indicating that the linear model, with or without parameter tuning (using default settings), does not capture a large portion of the variability in earthquake magnitude.\n","Potential reasons for the similar performance and low R-squared could include:\n","- Linear Regression might not be the most suitable model for this dataset and prediction task.\n","- The current set of features may not be strongly correlated with earthquake magnitude, or important features might be missing.\n","- The relationship between the features and magnitude might be non-linear.\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"6fb7c294"},"source":["## Summary:\n","\n","### Data Analysis Key Findings\n","\n","*   The dataset contains 23409 entries and 40 columns, including numerical and object types. There are no missing values.\n","*   Initial model training attempts failed due to the presence of non-numeric columns ('Type', 'Magnitude Type', 'Source', 'Status') in the feature set, which were subsequently dropped.\n","*   Both the Linear Regression model trained with default parameters and the one trained with \"custom\" (default) parameters showed virtually identical performance.\n","*   The Mean Squared Error (MSE) for both models was approximately 0.9438.\n","*   The R-squared score for both models was approximately 0.0915. This indicates that only about 9.15% of the variance in earthquake magnitude is explained by the features using this linear model.\n","\n","### Insights or Next Steps\n","\n","*   The current linear model, with default or the specified \"custom\" parameters, is not highly effective in predicting earthquake magnitude based on the given features.\n","*   Investigate alternative regression models (e.g., tree-based models, non-linear models) or explore feature engineering and selection to potentially improve the prediction performance.\n"]}]}
