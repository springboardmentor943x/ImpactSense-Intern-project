## Assignment: Develop a Machine Learning Web Application Using Streamlit 
### Objective 
Build an interactive web application that allows users to input data and get machine learning model 
predictions using Streamlit, a Python framework for building data apps. 
Assignment Tasks 
---
Task 1: Setup Environment 
-  Install Python 3.8+ and create a virtual environment. 
-  Install required libraries: streamlit, scikit-learn, pandas, numpy. 
-  Verify installation by running a simple Streamlit "Hello World" app. 
---
Task 2: Dataset and Model Preparation 
-  Choose a simple classification dataset (e.g., Iris Dataset from scikit-learn). 
-  Load the dataset using pandas or directly from sklearn.datasets. 
-  Train a basic ML model (e.g., Logistic Regression or Random Forest) for classification. 
-  Save the trained model to a file using joblib or pickle. 
---
Task 3: Streamlit App Development 
-  Create a Python script app.py. 
-  Use Streamlit to: 
-  Display the app title and description. 
-  Provide input widgets (e.g., sliders, dropdowns) to capture user input features corresponding 
to the model. 
-  Load the saved model. 
-  Make predictions based on user input. 
-  Display the prediction result and optionally the prediction probabilities.
--- 
Task 4: Add Data Exploration Features 
-  Add a sidebar with simple dataset exploratory visualizations such as: 
-  Histogram of features. 
-  Scatter plot of feature pairs. 
-  Allow toggling between data exploration mode and prediction mode. 
---
Task 5: App Styling and UX 
-  Use Streamlit layout features (columns, containers). 
-  Add helpful tooltips or markdown explanations for inputs. 
-  Use conditional formatting or color coding for prediction results. 
---
Task 6: Testing 
-  Run the app locally using streamlit run app.py. 
-  Test with different inputs. 
---
### Deliverables 
-  app.py with the full Streamlit app code. 
-  Model training script and saved model file. 
### Evaluation Criteria 
-  Correctness of ML model training and prediction. 
-  Functional and interactive Streamlit UI. 
-  Quality of data input handling and output presentation. 
-  Inclusion of dataset exploration features. 
-  Code organization, comments, and readability.
